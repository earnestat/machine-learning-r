Machine Learning in R @ Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Summer 2018
## Introductory words

This is an Introduction to Machine Learning in R, in which you'll learn the basics of unsupervised learning for _pattern recognition_ and supervised learning for _prediction_. At the end of this workshop, we hope that you'll

* appreciate the importance of performing exploratory data analysis (or EDA) before starting to model your data.
* understand the basics of _unsupervised learning_ and know the examples of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.
* understand the basics of _supervised learning_ for prediction and the differences between _classification_ and _regression_.
* understand modern machine learning techniques and principles, such as test train split, k-fold cross validation and regularization.
* be able to write code to implement the above techniques and methodologies using R, caret and glmnet.

The mathematical foundation for each section is not contained in these pages, as the instructor will explain and elaborate on the whiteboard.

## Acknowledgements

This material has come from many conversations, workshops and online courses over the years, most notably the work that I have done at DataCamp. Some of the material is similar to material that I developed for DataCamp's [
Supervised Learning with scikit-learn course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn), on which I collaborated with Andreas MÃ¼ller and Yashas Roy, along with community articles that I have written, such as [Kaggle Tutorial: EDA & Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/kaggle-machine-learning-eda) & [Experts' Favorite Data Science Techniques](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-techniques-dataframed). Finally, I found time to develop this material due to the 20% community time that I have at DataCamp and am indebted to them for this.
